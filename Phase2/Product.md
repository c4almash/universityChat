#### `Phase2/Product.md`

* Our product is a web based chat application for University of Toronto students. Users are required to have a __utoronto.ca__ or __toronto.edu__ email to sign up. After registering, users are able to login and access a global chat room where they are able to chat via text with other online users. Every message is saved so users can see the chat room's full history. After closing the browser, users sessions are saved so  that users are not required to provide credentials again upon revisiting the app. 

* We designed the login page to be minimal yet effective. If a user inputs invalid data such as a non-UofT email or a password that is too short, our login page elegantly displays an appropriate error message.
