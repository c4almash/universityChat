#### `Phase2/Product.md`

 * A report describing your __product__ (i.e. The _what_, not the _how_).
 * Please keep it short (2 min' read, seriously).
 * Be informative, but concise.
 * You can use your submissions from phase-1 as a starting point.
 * Focus on the features that you built during this phase, not on future plans.
