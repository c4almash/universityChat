# CSC301 Project: 
# Phase 1

For the first phase of the project, you will be using the various planning techniques we've learned in order to get ready for building your product. There are two main goals to this phase:
 * Understanding what product you want to build, and planning your first few steps.
 * Developing an efficient way of working together as a team (i.e. developing a process).

## First Step (Project Options)

Get together with your team (you can use your team repo to exchange contact information), and choose one of the 3 project options. Once you decide on a project, read this handout together, and make sure everybody is clear on what they need to do.

_Note:_ You will not be allowed to switch projects after this phase, so please make sure you are happy with your choice.

###  Messaging Application for Universities
#### [Android/Web/Console-application]

A messaging app that allows users to send/receive messages by topic. The idea is to provide students (and perhaps instructors, admin staff, etc.) with a convenient tool to broadcast (and consume) important/relevant information. 

The most basic features are:
 * A user can post messages to specific topic(s).
 * A user sees messages from all the topics he/she has subscribed for.

Just to give you an idea, here are example of hypothetical topics that could make sense: _1st Year Students_, _CSC301_, _Victoria College Events_, _St. George Traffic and Parking Notifications_, _Roommates Wanted_, etc.


### Time Management Tool for Students
#### [Android/Web/Console-application]

A tool that allows students to conveniently manage their schedule. The main highlight of the product is that it has all lecture and tutorial times, as well as all due dates, in one place.

The main challenge in this project comes from the (very realistic) assumption that instructors will not be cooperative. That is, you cannot count on instructors to create/update due dates. Your system, like most modern systems, should deal with this challenge by letting its users generate and validate the data.


### Frosh Week Treasure Hunt App
#### [Android]

[Treasure Hunt](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTreasure_hunt_%2528game%2529&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF96uF5D_3PYDeXyLgz9MglCz45bQ) is a classic choice for an event like Frosh Week - New students get to meet each other and explore the campus. The goal of this project is to build an app that will make a Frosh Week Treasure Hunt game a better experience.

Just to give you an idea, here are a few ways (some of them are too ambitious for this course) to improve a Treasure Hunt game using an app:
 * Notify teams whenever a competing team finds a clue.
 * Allow the Frosh Leaders to send extra clues to teams.
 * Whenever a team finds a clue, they need to take a picture, and at the end of the day, we end up with cool collages.
 * Provide students with online coupons to local cafes/restaurants as part of the game.
 * Indicate (hot/cold) whether you are getting closer to the location of the next clue, using the phone’s GPS.
 * Etc.



## Team Deliverables

All of your team’s deliverables should be submitted in a folder called `Phase1`, in the root of your __team repo__.
 * It is up to you to decide how to organize the files in the `Phase1` directory, and which format(s) to use (e.g. PDF, text, Markdown, etc.). 
 * Make sure it is easy for the marker to read your submission.
 * Suggestion: You can create a README.md file in the root of your team repo, and link to your submition from there.


#### What information should be included in the submission?

You submission should include the following information

 * Introducing the team (5 points)
   * One picture with all group members.
   * Short bio for each member (up to 150 words).
 * Choosing the project (5 points)
   * A short paragraph (up to 200 words).
   * Which option did you choose? 
   * Why did you choose it? 
   * How did you reach the decision as a group? 
 * Two Personas (5 point)
   * At least as detailed as the examples that appear in the lecture notes.
 * User Stories (20 points)
   * High-level stories to help you define the MVP.
   * More detailed stories to help you define your first release (i.e. The features you realistically plan to implement in Phase 2 of the project).
   * Detailed stories to help you plan your first iteration (iteration = 1 week of work).
   * We also want to see the lower-priority stories that you decide not to implement for the first release.
   * Stories should include priority and size/difficulty.    
     If you specify the priority and/or size using numbers, please let us know what the numbers mean. For example, you might choose to specify the priority of a feature/story as
     * 1 - We must have this feature, without it our product has no value to our users.
     * 2 - Valuable feature, but we can still release a product without it. 
     * 3 - Might be valuable, but we should look at it later.
 * MVP (15 points)
   * A short description (up to 300 words). 
   * This description is meant to be read by a non-technical client.
   * The initial project descriptions are open for interpretation, and we expect different teams to end up with fairly different products. We want to know what makes your team’s product special. Think of it as if you are trying to convince a client to choose your team’s proposal over other proposals.
   * Here are examples of things you may want to mention:
     * Cool features that make your product unique.
     * Technical challenges you are planning to overcome, and, by doing so, have an advantage over potential competition.
     * Unique user experience, based on an insight about your users.
 * Release & Iteration Planning (10 points)
   * Which user stories are you planning to implement for your first release?    
     That is, the features you will implement in Phase 2 (3 weeks long) of the project.
   * Mention 3 user-stories/features/components that you decided to exclude from your first release, and explain why you decided to postpone implementing them.
   * Which user stories are you planning to implement in the first iteration? (Iteration = 1 week of work)
 * CRC cards (15 point)
   * CRC Cards that show a high-level design of your software architecture.
   * Choose 3 user stories you are planning to implement early on, and “play out” their scenario using your CRC cards.
   * If you are not sure about what we mean by “playing out a scenario”, please make sure you attend the upcoming tutorial, as we will go through an example.

## Individual Deliverables

Your individual deliverable should be submitted in a file called `phase1-peer-eval.md`, in the root of your __personal repo__.

 * Evaluate each one of your teammates, __and explain__ your evaluation in 1-3 sentences.
 * Use the following evaluation scheme:
   * 0 - Absent, non-communicating and/or destructive.
   * 1 - Below average contribution.
   * 2 - Average contribution.
   * 3 - Above average contribution.
 * The total number of points you are allowed to give is __at most 2(team-size - 1)__.
 * That is, you have enough points to evaluate all of your teammates as average. If you evaluate someone above average, then you must evaluate someone else below average.
 * Please follow this format:
 
    ```
    * GitHubUsername1, NumericEvaluation - Explanation
    * GitHubUsername2, NumericEvaluation - Explanation
    …
    ```


## Marking

Your team’s deliverables will be graded on:
 * Content, as specified in the [Team Deliverables](#team-deliverables) section.
 * Arguments - For most questions in this phase, there are no right or wrong answers. What we want to see are strong arguments that support your answers.
 * Presentation - Writing clarity, proper grammar, organization, etc.

Here are some suggestions to help you get a high grade for this phase:
 * Go through your teammate’s work, and provide feedback to one another.
 * When you review your own work, take some time between writing and reviewing.
 * Try to communicate the same amount of information in less words.
 * Focus on content, not power words.

Each student’s final mark is determined by their team’s mark, and their teammates’ peer evaluation. Your final mark will be computed as follows:
 * Average all evaluations you received from your teammates.
 * Round the average (.5 will be rounded up).
 * Your final mark is your team’s mark multiplied by a factor of
   * 1, if your rounded average evaluation is 3
   * 0.9, if your rounded average evaluation is 2
   * 0.75, if your rounded average evaluation is 1
   * 0, if your rounded average evaluation is 0
 * A student that doesn’t submit a peer evaluation (or submits an incomplete evaluation), will get a mark of 0 for this phase.

# Phase 2 - Implementation

The main goal of this phase is to implement and present the first working version of your product. 

It is up to you to choose what to implement, and how much work to put into this phase.
We expect you to try to get as much work done as possible, while being realistic about your busy schedule.

__Important:__ To ensure that you're not planning to do too much or too little, you must get your release plan approved by your TA __by Thursday, Oct 23, at 9 pm__.

Another goal of this phase is to get a better understanding of the Scrum model/framework.
You will follow a [scrum-like process](#our-scrum-like-process), and will be asked to document and evaluate the process.



## Team Deliverables

 * Your team repo is your main deliverable - It contains your code, `.md` files, commit history, and issues.
 * [Live Demo](#live-demo)
 * [`Phase2/Product.md`](#phase2productmd)
 * [`Phase2/Process.md`](#phase2processmd)


#### Live Demo

 * To be presented __During tutorial, on Nov 10__.
 * Short - Max' 10 minutes (including time for Q&A).
 * Presented by 2 team members
   * One doing most of the talking ("the navigator"), and the other runs things on the computer ("the driver").
   * The TA will choose the 2 students on the spot, so you should all be ready to present.
   * The two students get to decide who will be the navigator and who will be the driver.
 * It is your responsibility to verify that you have everything that you need for your demo (e.g. adaptors, cables, etc.). If you have any questions/requests, please use the discussion board or contact your TA in advance.

#### `Phase2/Product.md`

 * A report describing your __product__ (i.e. The _what_, not the _how_).
 * Please keep it short (2 min' read, seriously).
 * Be informative, but concise.
 * You can use your submissions from phase-1 as a starting point.
 * Focus on the features that you built during this phase, not on future plans.

#### `Phase2/Process.md`
 
 A report describing your scrum-like process. The report should include the following items:
 
  * A summary of your planning and review meetings for both sprints (i.e. 4 meetings in total).
    * Includes date and location.
    * Please keep it short, and give us the highlights.
    * Include important decisions you've made, and arguments for/against them.
    * Tip: You can use GitHub to label all the user stories you plan to complete during a sprint, and include a link to an issue search result ([example](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/CSC301H1F-L5101-Home/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ARelease-Plan-1+)) in your planning meeting summary.
    * For the review/retrospective meeting, we would like to see some numbers and/or interesting statistics.   
      For example: Percentage of planned work that was actually completed, distribution of completed work among team members, percentage of planned work completed categorized by priority, etc.    
      The point is to evaluate the estimations that you've made during the planning meeting.
  * A summary of your "daily" scrum meetings.
    * Please include date and location.
    * If you use a chat, you can simply copy-paste the highlight of the chat.
    * Otherwise, please give us a very quick summary.    
      A good format would be a list, specifying the highlights of each member's update (each highlights should be 1-3 sentences long).
  * Description of how you used GitHub issue management system (e.g. naming conventions, labels, team's conventions, etc.)
  * Description of any other major decisions/conventions you may have made/used during the process, and why.
    * For example: Did you have a "scrum master"? Why? Do you think it was the right decision?
  


## Individual Deliverables

The following files shoulds be submitted to the root of your __personal repo__.

 * [`proj-phase2-individual-contrib.md`](#proj-phase2-individual-contribmd)
 * [`proj-phase2-short-answers.md`](#proj-phase2-short-answersmd)


#### `proj-phase2-individual-contrib.md`

 * Describe your most significant individual contribution.   10%
   * Must be a technical contribution (i.e. “I was in charge of documentation” doesn’t fly).
     For example: A nasty bug that you resolved, a component that you've implemented elegantly, a complicated problem that you had to solve, etc.
   * A good description should include links to specific commit(s) and/or issue(s) on GitHub.


#### `proj-phase2-short-answers.md`

* Answer the following questions (2-3 sentences for each answer)
  * What did you like the most about your Scrum-like process, and why?
  * What did you dislike the most about your Scrum-like process, and why?

## Our Scrum-like Process


Scrum is used by teams where most/all members work full-time, 
usually in the same physical space, and the project is ongoing. 
Our situation is different, so we will adapt scrum to fit our realistic constraints.

Here is a description of the scrum-like process we would like you to follow.

### The players

 * Development team - All members of the team.
 * Scrum Master
   * In a real agile team, the scrum master is not a member of the development team.
   * In our case, the “scrum master” will be a team member who volunteers to facilitate the process (e.g. Scheduling, organize note taking, recording the meetings, and/or anything else you might find useful).
   * It is up to you to decide whether or not to have a "scrum master". If nobody volunteers, or the team decides that it is unnecessary, that's totally fine.
 * There is no product owner.
   * The closest thing to a product owner is your TA, who has to approve your release plan.

### The artifacts

 * Use GitHub issue management system to keep track of all user-stories/tasks.
 * It is up to you to decide on how to use the system (i.e. Which labels to use, naming conventions, how to assign/pick-up issues, how to prioritize stories, etc.)

   
### The events

 * Sprints
   * Two sprints, each sprint between 7 to 10 days.
   * Different teams might have different scheduling constraints, so we’ll leave it up to you to decide on the exact dates.
   * The two sprints should be roughly of even length.
   * If your schedule permits, we suggest that you review sprint-1 and plan sprint-2 on separate days (to give you some time to reflect, and reach conclusions).
 * Sprint planning meeting
   * At the beginning of each sprint.
   * Try your best to get everybody to meet in person. In extreme cases, when scheduling is too problematic, consider using a video chat.
   * At the end of this meeting you should know which user-stories you plan/commit to implement during this sprint.
 * Daily Scrum meeting
   * We ask you to hold 2-3 of these short meetings during each sprint.
   * Try to get as many team members as possible.
   * You can run these meetings in person or via video/voice/text chat.
   * Remember, these are supposed to be short meetings (15 min’ max). The goals are to keep everybody in sync, and to exchange relevant information.
 * Sprint Review/Retrospective meeting
   * At the end of each sprint.
   * At the end of this meeting you should know how much of the planned work was actually done, and what are the next main challenges.
   * Tip: You’ll need to document this meeting, so please make sure you have enough time between reviewing sprint-2 and the due date.
