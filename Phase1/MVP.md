We will be making a real-time messaging app for the web, targeted at university
students and faculty. Initially, we will only be opening this service up to
University of Toronto students and faculty; users must use their mail.utoronto.ca
email to register. Any user will be able to join, subscribe, create, and participate
in channels, which are essentially chatrooms revolving around a single theme, such
as a particular club or course, or more general topics such as faculties and school
events.

The messaging app will have a well-designed and easy-to-use interface. While it is
easy to say these things, these claims are not unsubstantiated: our team is dedicated
to crafting a beautiful and enjoyable user experience. The design for our application
will lean towards a minimalistic interface when possible.

There are several technical challenges associated with such a project. Latency, or
the delay time between a user sending a message to a channel and all users subscribed
to that channel receiving the message, is extremely crucial in such a real-time
application. There must be little delay in the app for maximum responsitivity. Fortunately,
our team is familiar with programming tools focused on lowering latency. In designing
systems and circuits, engineers often use error budgets to keep an upper bound on the
number of errors in a system. For our application, we will similarly introduce a
latency budget to ensure that the average latency between message send and push is
within acceptable limits.

In conclusion, our application will be the easiest and hassle-free way for any student
or faculty member to instantly participate in real-time public dialogue.
