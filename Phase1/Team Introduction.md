    - I'm a 4th year compsci student enrolled in UTSC but taking a semester at UTSG. I've worked part time as a web developer for       almost two years and enjoy working on the UI/UX as much as the full software development cycle. A strength of mine is that        I am highly motivated to work on 'real life' projects, meaning that the released result will be used publicly. The inverse        of this is my weakness, where I may find it difficult to work on projects that will not be used by anyone upon completion.
