  - **AlexDar** - c4darmin
    - I'm a 4th year compsci student enrolled in UTSC but taking a semester
      at UTSG. I've worked part time as a web developer for almost two years
      and enjoy working on the UI/UX as much as the full software development
      cycle. A strength of mine is that I am highly motivated to work on 'real
      life' projects, meaning that the released result will be used publicly.
      The inverse of this is my weakness, where I may find it difficult to work
      on projects that will not be used by anyone upon completion.
