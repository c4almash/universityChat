User stories to be included in our first release:


3 user-stories/features/components that are not in our first release:

  why?
  
  - no private chat rooms for first release because that's not
    the main purpose of this app.
  - user cannot subscribe to topics in first release because it
    is a bit difficult to implement. They will see all topics.
  - something extremely hard will not be implemented in first
    release because it is extremely difficult to implement. :goberserk:
