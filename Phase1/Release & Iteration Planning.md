### Features to be implemented in Phase 2

```

Priority: HIGH

User story #:

Priority: HIGH
```

  The goal of Phase 2 is to create an application that is able to represent and define the core of our Messaging Application. We would like for our users to sign up and create an account where their Username is identified based off their UofT email address. This will focus on the validation of University students. In addition, the creation of channels that will be used for discussion must be completed as well as the accessibility of these channels to other users. By the end of Phase 2, users should also be able to search and filter through channel names. 

### Three-user stories excluded

```
User story #:
As Brenda, I want to be able to change my password.
Priority: MEDIUM

User story #:
As Brenda, I want to be able to block someone, so I do not see their messages. 
Priority: Low

User story #:
As Dr. Johnson, I want my channel’s administrator’s to be able to hide individual messages.
Priority: HIGH
```
	
  Though the user stories mentioned above are important and are useful to the user, they are not essential and do not define the purpose of the application. Password changes can be implemented afterwards but are not required at such an early stage. We want people to categorize and chat with others on similar topics first before implementing blocking feature.Implementing the actual discussion groups are prioritized more than preventing people from chatting. Private messages aren’t necessary just quite yet, but would be neat to have in the future.

Stories to be implemented in first iteration

In the first iteration we should have implemented:

-	Registering a user and creating their account
-	Creating a channel and seeing available channels
