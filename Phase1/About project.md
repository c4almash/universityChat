## Choosing the project

The team has unanimously chose the **Messaging Application for University**
as the project to be worked on for this course.

The *Messaging App* option was chosen based on a group survey conducted in
the very early phase of the project. In this survey, we've discovered an
overwhelming interest in building an web-based application. Additionally,
everyone in the team either has a bit of web programming experience already
or is willing to learn it for this project.

Based on this realization, the *Treasure Hunt App* was out of the scope
for our project since it is only Android based which not a lot of team
member has any experience or the interest in making. The choice between
*Time Management Tool* vs. *Messaging Application* was even more clear cut.

The bloatedness of present day University *Time Management Tool* makes
us not even want to be reminded of due to how bad it is. In contrast, the
*Messaging Application* has been popular since its inception, and seeing
how much popular messaging apps in the app stores just makes us want to
build one even more.
