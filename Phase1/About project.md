## Choosing the project

The team has unanimously chosen the **Messaging Application for University**
as the project to be worked on for this course.

The *Messaging App* option was selected based on a group survey conducted
in the very early phase of the project. In this survey, we discovered an
overwhelming interest in building a web-based application. Additionally,
everyone in the team either has some web programming experience or is
willing to learn it for this project.

Based on this realization, the *Treasure Hunt App* became out of our scope
for this project since it is the only Android based application which few
team members have any experience or the interest in making. The choice
between *Time Management Tool* vs. *Messaging Application* became even more
clear cut.

The bloatedness of present day University *Time Management Tool* makes
us not even want to be reminded of due to how bad it is. In contrast, the
*Messaging Application* has been popular since its inception, and seeing
a number of popular messaging apps in the app stores just makes us want to
build one even more.
