## Kanban Process Report
  * The names of columns your team chose to use for the Kanban board.
    - __Todo__, __Developing__, __Under review__, and __Done__
     
    
  * The WIP (work in progress) limit(s) you chose.     
    - 3
    
  * Details on how you used GitHub issues - Labels, naming conventions, enforcing WIP limits, etc.
    - Our labels for the issues match exactly our columns so it's clear to tell which state a task falls in. However, to be even more flexible, we always start with a quick discussion on Facebook to decide what to do and who is in charge of it. And post them on GitHub issues later to keep things organized. We kept three as our WIP limit because we always work in pairs.
 
  * Your opinion about using Kanban versus the Scrum-like process (from phase 2) for your project.     
    * In both Scrum-like process and Kanban, we prioritized items and split work into small doable tasks, so that we could have a good idea of total work and plan well for them. However, there were some trickier tasks, which may take longer time than the others, but we wouldn't notice until started working on them. If it's in the middle of a sprint, unfinished tasks would be passed to next sprint, which might disturb the entire plan. But in Kanban, we are not limited to sprints. We just continuously work on each task, as best as we can, till done. Another advantage of Kanban is that there's no sprint review or retrospective meeting, which is time-saving for team like us with members from different campuses. In conclusion, we prefer Kanban as it's more flexible to changes and more suitable for self-disciplined teams, like us. It has less prescriptive rules and gives more freedom to developers. Especially around this time of the semester, when we have so many assignments due at the same time, we really appreciate the flexibility of it. We worked as much as we can and chose not to promise too much in this phase, so we would make it up in the next phase. As a short-term project, Kanban is good enough to keep things organized. But for less self-disciplined teams or long-term projects, Kanban might encourage procrastination. In this case, scrum-like process is a better fit to guide them to progress, or they might end up with a mess by the end of the iteration.
