# Individual Reports

-----

## oneohtrix

 * My most significant individual contribution was implementing multi-room functionality, which was tricky.
 * I learned the value of a DAO when creating one to abstract away the interface for creating domain-specific objects.
 * My main strength is the experience I have working in web development.
 * I could have kept people more informed of what I was doing, since one of my PRs required a substantial merge since it had many conflicts.

## g3aishih

 * My most significant individual contribution was implementing the functions dealing with passwords (ie, change password, forgot password).
 * I learned about the process to move and process data in the backend. I learned basic concepts of node.js, cookies and post/get requests. I had very limited experience working with these before this project.
 * I learn things pretty quickly, when given new tasks to conquer using an unfamiliar language, I was able to learn the material needed to complete the task in an small amount of time.
 * I had little to no prior experience working with some of the frameworks we used in this project so I could not reach out and help my teammates when they had an issue in their code. I should have worked with my teammates to solve issues which can affect the entire project rather than just focusing on my code alone.
