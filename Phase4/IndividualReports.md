## oneohtrix

 * My most significant individual contribution was implementing multi-room functionality, which was tricky.
 * I learned the value of a DAO when creating one to abstract away the interface for creating domain-specific objects.
 * My main strength is the experience I have working in web development.
 * I could have kept people more informed of what I was doing, since one of my PRs required a substantial merge since it had many conflicts.
