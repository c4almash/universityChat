# Individual Reports

## oneohtrix

 * My most significant individual contribution was implementing multi-room functionality, which was tricky.
 * I learned the value of a DAO when creating one to abstract away the interface for creating domain-specific objects.
 * My main strength is the experience I have working in web development.
 * I could have kept people more informed of what I was doing, since one of my PRs required a substantial merge since it had many conflicts.

## g3aishih

 * My most significant individual contribution was implementing the functions dealing with passwords (ie, change password, forgot password)@commit: b7f5418 Pull Request #58.
 * I learned about the process to move and process data in the backend. I learned basic concepts of node.js, cookies and post/get requests. I had very limited experience working with these before this project.
 * I learn things pretty quickly, when given new tasks to conquer using an unfamiliar language, I was able to learn the material needed to complete the task in an small amount of time.
 * I had little to no prior experience working with some of the frameworks we used in this project so I could not reach out and help my teammates when they had an issue in their code. I should have worked with my teammates to solve issues which can affect the entire project rather than just focusing on my code alone.

## timothylai

* My most significant contrubution was the implementation of the logout function #53.
* While working on our web app, I learned about web programming using html, css, and js.
* I try my best to be helpful to my team - I am not an experienced web programmer, but I did what I can by contributing to the team repository using knowledge of web programming I've learned over the month.
* I could have learned more about web programming - I still do not understand the react framework we are using very well, if I've known better I would have contributed more.

## SunnyLi

 * My most significant contrubution for phase 4 was helping Lawrence to complete the multi-room functionality
   implemented in PR #52. There were some bugs on the server-side code initially that stopped the application
   from functioning properly. I located the problem and fixed it so the application works again and the
   pull request can be merged.
 * While working on our web based chat application, I learned a great deal about the ReactJS framework
   and acquired a bit more experience working with nodejs.
 * I am always looking out for my teammates - I helped Timothy set up his development environment,
   and get up to speed with the tools we've used such as the sass command line tool for compiling
   scss to vanilla css styles and react-tools to compile react jsx templates to plain javascript.
 * I frequently manage the issues list by adding related labels to it and also closing issues where
   the problem have already been fixed. I also resolve a lot of merge conflicts so that pull requests
   can be accepted.

## g3abby

 * My most significant individual contribution is to help in the front-end development.
 * I learned web programming languages, html, javascript, and css. And some basic knowledge of node.js.
 * My main strength being in the team is that I know my ability and tried my best to assist team members to write good codes. I did a lot of write ups and helped communicate with TA and professor.
 * I could have spent more time to learn and understand the underlying logic and framework of our project, so that I could work at the same pace with my teammates.

## c4darmin

 * My most significant individual contribution was in front end debugging, usually by enforcing input sanity and restricting components to certain dimensions even with large inputs.
 * I learned a lot about git, especially the benefits of the issue system, version control and conflict resolution.
 * My main strength was communicating tasks with the team and also debugging. I was the only one to discover a number of issues that occured if sufficiently annoying inputs were used to register.
 * If I had managed my time better, I could have made our app responsive and look great across all platforms (phones, tablets, laptops, desktops).
