A short report telling us the highlights of your product.

Max' 500 words.
The goals of this report are:
Inform potential users of the major product decisions you made:
Which features (that weren't a part of the original handout) did you choose to focus on?
How do you expect a typical user to use your product? (i.e. run us through a quick scenario or two).
Give your TA and/or instructor some context, before they see your live presentation.

Firstly, we satisfied the original requirements which were as follows:
<ul>
<li>A: A user can post messages to specific topic(s).</li>
<li>B: A user sees messages from all the topics he/she has subscribed for.</li>
</ul>

We improved the above requirements in a number of ways:
<ol>
<li> In addition to seeing messages to subscribed topics, users can access the complete message logs
of any topics they subscribe to in the future.</li>
<li> We have a global topic where users can post about anything (safe for work!).</li>
</ol>
