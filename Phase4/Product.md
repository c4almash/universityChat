Firstly, we satisfied the original requirements which were as follows:

* A user can post messages to specific topic(s).</li>
* A user sees messages from all the topics he/she has subscribed for.</li>


We improved the above requirements in a number of ways:
<ol>
<li> In addition to seeing messages to subscribed topics, users can access the complete message logs
of any topics they subscribe to in the future.</li>
<li> We have a global topic where users can post about anything.</li>
</ol>

We focused on making our web application visually sleak and functionally intuitive to use. By committing to a grayscale set of colors, we create a tranquil environment for our users. To synergize the user experience with the app's calm theme, we focused on making our app super easy to use. We achieve this by making the registration process ridiculously quick, simply input your email, password, and you're done; you're logged in. Your username becomes the first component of the email you register with; so if you register with `foo.bar@mail.utoronto.ca` then your username would be "foo.bar" (everything before the @ symbol).

Our app will have rooms for each course. Students are recommended to login and discuss course work without giving out answers! This is essentially an online hub for students to meet other students and discuss course content. Many students (like a part of our group) rarely go to classes and this would be a great way for this set of students to easily meet classmates for future work.
